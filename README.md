Rime-Typewriter
==============================

This is a learning tool designed to learn input methods
provided in Rime, in particular Combo Pinyin.

This repo is a fork of the subtree of [lotem/rimeime](https://github.com/lotem/rimeime/).
I added functionalities to provide support for my comboing
scheme [10dpy](https://github.com/EtaoinWu/10dpy).
